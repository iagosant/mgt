  <p id="doneeWords">“Dear friends, as you may know, one of muy closest and oldest friends, Michael G. Thibodeau, passed away due to a sudden and unforeseen illsness on February 13th. Michael’s unexpected passing has caused a massive ripple effect of emotions within the hearts and souls of those who knew him best, and at the tender age of 30, his loved one - like myself, are at a loss of understanding as to how or why this could have happened. Nonetheless, we have to lost our deam Michael and we have no recourse but to face our grief head on. The process of grief has been undeniably difficult for me these past few weeks, but I have found comfort and solace by the support of friends like you and the love so many have expressed for Michael.</p>
  <p>Michael was an avid reader, a gifted poet and film- maker. His thoughts, words, and visionary spirit will live on within my memories. Always. Mike was more that just the sum of his hobbies; however, he was the type of friends that always made you feel at ease. He was a calming and a gentle soul who enjoyed and lived life to the fullest.</p>
  <p>I met Mike on our freshman year of college; he was the friend I made. He asked to sit with me in the dining hall and since that day, we grew to become the best of friends! Having attended college together, then living in both Miami and New York City together, I could speak endlessly of my times with Mike, you would love the stories!</p>
